# SpeechToArduino

The second task that were required from us in the IoT track in the summer intership with Smart Methods is to recognize the speech and then deal with it in Arduino. This task contained an HTML file for the front end and a Javascript file that is for the backend stuff and then an Aduino file that is for the programming of the arduino itself.
